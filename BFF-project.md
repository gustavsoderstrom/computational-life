Ok, so I need your help planning the following project:

I want to implement the BFF project by Blaise Aguera y Arcas found in @BFF-research-paper.pdf

I want you to:
1. read the paper carefully, follow any links in the paper
2. find the repo of the BFF implementation (probably in the paper). Analyze it carefully 
3. Summarize and explain it back to me and list the experiments they've done so that I can ask you questions about it.
4. Implemenet the BFF experiment (inluding whatever runtimes and dependencies I need to download etc) so that I can replicate the experiments on my computer.

As you think through this plan, I also want you to tell me the best way to set up the experiment so that I use the context memory you have as efficiently as possible, should I for example use sub agents and/or skills for part of the project so that I can keep the main context memory as open as possible? Should I jettison the playwright mcp for this project to free up more context memory (unless you think I need the playwrigt MCP for the research phase?)

Give a plan but don't write any code yet
